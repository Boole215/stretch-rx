Press your shoulder blades into your back and, with an inhale, lift your upper torso and head away from the floor.  Exhale while lowering your body back onto the floor.  Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, breathing smoothly.",
    "comments":"Depending on how high you arch your back and lift your chest, either the back or top of your head will rest on the floor. There should be a minimal amount of weight on your head to avoid straining your neck.",
